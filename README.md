# workout-logger

<h3>how to run the backend:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Open IntelliJ</li>
  <li>Go to File>Open</li>
  <li>Select the pom.xml file in the backend directory and click open as project</li>
  <li>Wait for maven to sync</li>
  <li>Run WorkoutLoggerApplication</li>
  <li>The application will be hosted on localhost:8080</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently the database is not yet hosted. In order to properly run the application, you need a PostgreSQL database running on localhost:5432 named workout_log_db.
  There is a backup.sql provided that should generate the proper database schema</p>
